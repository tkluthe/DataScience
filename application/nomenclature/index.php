      <h3>Things to know before you begin:</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Before you begin the study, we will ask you to review an Informed Consent Document which outlines the procedures of the study and the risks and benefits of participation.  You will have an opportunity to ask questions about the document and the procedures before you begin.</li>
        <li>Your answers are confidential and recorded in our results database without any personally identifiable information. We request an email address for contact purposes which is kept in a separate database file.</li>
        <li>If you have been offered the opportunity for extra credit in a course, you will be asked for personal information so that we may notify your instructor of your participation in the study.  This information will be kept in the separate database file with your contact information. Only the research team members will see your answers and results on the study tasks.  They will not be available to your course instructor.</li>
        <li>You may or may not be physically supervised during the study, but in either case it is important that you do not search the internet or use materials other than what is given to you as part of the study. This behavior could impact the results of the study and would make your participation pointless.</li>
        <li>Since this study involves a timed element and writing code, it requires either a desktop or laptop computer and cannot be completed on a mobile device.</li>
        <li>You have the right to terminate the study at any time, but we will not be able to utilize the data <b>unless you reach the Completion Page</b>.</li>
      </ul>
