        <h4>Benefits of Participation</h4>
        <p>There may not be direct benefits to you as a participant in this study.  However, we hope to learn about how people interact with scientific programming languages and tools.</p>
        <h4>Risks of Participation</h4>
        <p>There are risks involved in all research studies. This study may include only minimal risks. You may experience some mental stress while reading through questions and considering answers. This study is being conduct remotely, and while we do our best to keep all information confidential, no computer security mechanism is perfectly secure.</p>
        <h4>Cost/Compensation</h4>
        <p>There may not be financial cost to you to participate in this study.  The study will take 30-60 minutes of your time.  Compensation will be provided as 2% extra credit in courses where the instructor allowed study advertisement. As an alternative to getting this compensation if you choose not to participate, you may also write a short paper (2 pages) on a topic related to the course. If you are not in a course that offers extra credit, there will be no compensation.</p>
        <h4>Funding</h4>
		<p>This research is funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>
		<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
        <p>All information gathered in this study will be kept as confidential as possible.  No reference will be made in written or oral materials that could link you to this study.  All records will be stored in a locked facility at UNLV for 5 years after completion of the study.  Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you.</p>
        <h4>Voluntary Participation</h4>
        <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate in this study or in any part of this study.  You may withdraw at any time without prejudice to your relations with UNLV. You are encouraged to ask questions about this study at the beginning or any time during the research study.
